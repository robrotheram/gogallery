# GoGallery

GoGallery as the name suggests is a web gallery software with a golang backend. It is driven of a filebase backend. ie collections/albums are folders with photos. The inspiration for this gallery is to provide a some of the functionaities of my old gallery cms Koken which has had no updates in over a year+ and had gone silent. *NOTE* that this is not a replacement for Koken just the very limited features I was using. 

The application uses react frontend and a seperate react dashboard that supports upload and managing photos in collections.
